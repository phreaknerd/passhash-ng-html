# Password Hasher NG Firefox extension
html version based on [Password Hasher NG Firefox extension](https://github.com/phreaknerd/passhash-ng)


## What does it do?
The hasher is generating a unique password for every site you visit. 
This works simply by creating a so called hash from the site-tag and your master-key. 

Bam. Different passwords for every site. You only have to remember your master-key which is never stored anywhere.
